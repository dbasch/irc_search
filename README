This is a bot that connects to an irc channel and indexes all public messages with IndexTank.

How to use it:

- gem install indextank

Go to indextank.com and get an account. Replace your api url in config.yaml.
Set the channel you want to index too.

Run indexer.rb, it will create an index for your channel the first time it runs.
While running, it will index every public message on the channel.

If you want to use search.html you'll need to make your index public and edit
the page accordingly. On your dashboard click on Manage for your index and enable 
public search api. Replace your public api and index name in search.html and it should work.
